# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project intends to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Domain cutover + CI/CD**: deployed to Cloudflare (Workers with static
  assets, the currently-recommended path over the legacy Pages product,
  same CDN/edge) at `wayfarer.ashwinsathian.com`. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  now auto-deploys to production on every push to `master` that CI passes
  (gated on the `CI` workflow's own conclusion, not a duplicate check).
  `.github/workflows/preview.yml` uploads a Cloudflare Workers Version for
  every PR, a real, working preview URL that never receives production
  traffic, and comments it on the PR. `api-sandbox.ashwinsathian.com` was
  never actually deployed (confirmed directly against the account before
  this change), so no redirect was needed from it.
- A Trust Center (`docs/trust-center.md`) and a pre-answered procurement
  security questionnaire (`docs/security-questionnaire.md`), so a security
  reviewer can find the data-residency, encryption, subprocessor, and
  compliance-status facts in one place instead of filing a ticket.
- `/.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116) for automated vulnerability-scanner
  discovery, linked from `SECURITY.md`.
- **Local Bridge** (`local-bridge/`): an optional, zero-dependency companion
  process that relays requests to CORS-restrictive or intranet-only APIs a
  browser tab structurally cannot reach. Binds to `127.0.0.1` only, gates
  every relay call on both an Origin allowlist and a persisted,
  constant-time-compared token. Run it with `npm run bridge`; enable it
  from the new router icon in the app toolbar. See `local-bridge/README.md`
  for the full security model and known limitations.
- `BridgeService` and a Local Bridge settings dialog in the app shell for
  configuring and testing the connection to a running bridge instance.
  `MainService.sendRequest()` now routes through the bridge when enabled,
  re-deriving the same success/error response shape a direct fetch would
  produce so the rest of the request pipeline (scripts, assertions,
  history) is unaffected either way.
- A `local-bridge` CI job running the companion's own `node --test` suite.
- **Save to Collection**: the request composer can now actually save its
  contents into a collection. Previously the only way to add a request to a
  collection was the sidebar's "New Request" prompt (name + method only,
  empty URL), with no way to ever edit it again. `CollectionsService`/
  `CollectionsRepository`/`IdbService` gain a real `updateRequest()`, and the
  composer gets a **Save** action (icon button next to Send) that writes the
  full current state (method, URL, headers, body, auth, pre/post-request
  scripts, and tests) back to the bound request, plus a **Save to
  Collection** dialog (name + collection + optional folder picker) for a
  request that isn't bound to one yet. Closes the gap between this and the
  README's existing "saved to a Collection for later reuse" claim, which
  wasn't actually possible before this change.
- An explicit **New Request** action (icon button in the composer, and the
  previously-inert mobile sidebar button, which only closed the drawer and
  didn't touch the composer at all) that clears the form and drops any
  collection-request binding.
- Folder/collection icons in the collections tree. Previously a folder and
  a collection both rendered as plain, indistinguishable label text.
- Six more command palette (⌘K) actions: New Request, Send Request, Focus
  Address Bar, toggle theme, open History, lock/unlock secrets, open Local
  Bridge settings, Reset All Data, registered alongside the existing
  collection/folder commands. The palette previously had exactly one
  command ("New Collection").
- **A dedicated Secrets management view** (`SecretsManagerComponent`), a
  dialog matching the Local Bridge settings dialog's visual/interaction
  pattern, listing every secret across every environment in one place with
  lock-aware reveal, rename, delete, and a "locate" chip that jumps to
  wherever a secret is referenced. Previously secrets were only manageable
  as flagged rows buried inside the Environments editor, under-signposting
  the "vault" concept the first-use flow sets up. Reuses `SecretsService`/
  `SecretCryptoService`/`SecretsRepository` for all crypto and persistence;
  added the missing `listAll()`/`renameSecret()`/`deleteSecret()` aggregate
  methods to `SecretsRepository`. Registered in the command palette and a
  toolbar icon button.
- **A dedicated Settings surface** (`SettingsComponent`) consolidating the
  theme toggle, environments export/import, Reset All Data, Local Bridge
  settings, and a keyboard-shortcuts reference (a live list of every
  registered command-palette action), previously scattered across the
  toolbar and command palette with no single home. Registered in the
  command palette and a toolbar icon button.
- **A resizable split between the request composer and the response
  viewer** on desktop widths (PrimeNG `p-splitter`), replacing a
  fixed-width centered layout that left large amounts of dead canvas at
  1024–1440px+. The chosen split ratio persists across reloads.
- A `prefers-reduced-motion` convention (a CSS override plus a
  `prefersReducedMotion()` helper for the one Angular-animations-driven
  surface a media query can't reach), the app's first. Tab switches
  (composer, response viewer, environments editor, mobile accordion),
  response arrival, and dialog open/close now animate deliberately using
  the existing spring-easing design tokens, respecting that setting.

### Changed

- **Test runner migrated from Karma/Jasmine to Vitest**, running in real
  headless Chromium via Vitest's Playwright browser provider rather than
  jsdom. jsdom doesn't faithfully implement the Web Workers/IndexedDB/
  WebCrypto APIs that `script-sandbox.service.spec.ts` (the sandbox-escape
  regression suite) and several other specs genuinely exercise. All 21 spec
  files ported; `karma.conf.js` and the Karma/Jasmine dependencies removed.
- **Zoneless change detection adopted** (`provideZonelessChangeDetection()`).
  `zone.js` is now fully removed from the repo, dev and prod (confirmed
  by a 0-byte `polyfills` chunk in the production build). Zoneless CD
  flushes signal writes to the DOM asynchronously rather than
  synchronously-post-event, which surfaced one real race in an existing e2e
  test; fixed by asserting on an auto-retrying condition instead of
  chaining actions blindly, the correct pattern for zoneless UIs generally.
- Completed the signal-based Angular migration: `inject()` everywhere (0
  remaining constructor-parameter DI), and the two remaining
  `@ViewChild("editorHost")` setter-pattern queries (`json-editor`,
  `script-editor`) migrated to `viewChild()` + `effect()`.
- Split the six most oversized files in the codebase into cohesive
  services/components/utils behind their existing public APIs, so no
  consumer outside each split file needed to change. `api-params.component.ts`
  (1,174 → 868 lines: extracted `RequestSaveService`, `AuthEditorComponent`,
  and several `shared/http/*.util.ts` helpers), `collections-sidebar.component.ts`
  (732 → 572: extracted `CollectionImportService` and tree/context-menu
  utils), `response-viewer.component.ts` (649 → 432: extracted timing/export
  utils), `idb-core.service.ts` (555 → 280 + two new schema/migration
  files), `collections.repository.ts` (538 → 260 + two new per-aggregate
  repositories), `environments-manager.component.ts` (451 → 383: extracted
  `EnvironmentImportService`).
- Rebuilt the mobile composer as a strictly single-panel-at-a-time
  accordion (previously all tabs rendered simultaneously, stacked and
  unlabeled, at narrow widths) and fixed Monaco initializing inside
  zero-width containers by waiting for a resolved non-zero width before
  creating the editor instance.

### Fixed

- **Monaco's background language workers (JSON/CSS/HTML/TypeScript validation
  and completion) had never actually run in the deployed production build.**
  They were loaded via `import("monaco-editor/.../*.worker?worker")`, a
  Vite-specific dynamic-import convention that happened to work under
  `ng serve` only because Angular's dev server is Vite-based. Angular's
  production builder (`ng build`, esbuild but not Vite) doesn't implement
  that convention at all: it silently imported each worker file as an
  ordinary module with no exports, so every worker constructor resolved to
  `undefined`. Verified directly: a production build's worker imports were
  `undefined` 5/5 times, and the identical dev-mode code was a real
  constructor 5/5 times, confirmed structurally by the production bundle
  finally emitting genuine, separately-named `*-worker.js` chunks
  (`json-worker`, `css-worker`, `html-worker`, `typescript-worker`,
  `editor-worker`) after the fix, which it never had before. Found while
  chasing an unrelated CI e2e flake (below) that only reproduced against a
  cold/production environment, never a warm local dev server. Fixed by
  switching to Angular's own `new Worker(new URL(...))` syntax, the same
  builder-native mechanism `script-sandbox.service.ts`'s worker already
  uses, via five thin wrapper files under `src/app/shared/monaco/workers/`
  (one per worker; each just re-exports monaco-editor's own worker script
  so the builder has a literal, statically-analyzable entry point to
  bundle).
- A PrimeNG `ConfirmDialog` accessibility bug, live in production the whole
  time: its "headless" custom-content mode (used here for the design
  system's warning-icon styling) always auto-generates an `aria-labelledby`
  pointing at an internal header `<span>` that headless mode never actually
  renders, leaving every open confirm dialog (clear history, reset all
  data, delete secret, etc.) with a permanently dangling accessible-name
  reference for screen reader users. An existing attempted fix
  (`fixConfirmDialogAriaLabelledBy()`) was a silent no-op: its selector
  (`[data-pc-name="dialog"]`) didn't match what this PrimeNG version
  actually renders (`data-pc-name="t"`). Corrected the selector to
  `.p-confirmdialog[role="alertdialog"]` (the class axe itself reports as
  the violating node) and replaced a bare `setTimeout(fn)`, a Zone-era
  "run after this render" idiom, with `afterNextRender()`, the correct
  zoneless-safe equivalent.
- CI's e2e job now builds once and serves the static production output
  (via Python's stdlib `http.server`, no new dependency) instead of
  running `ng serve`, and three accessibility-spec timing assumptions that
  only held by coincidence under the slower dev server were hardened:
  waiting for a genuinely-open `pTooltip` to close (Playwright's `click()`
  leaves the cursor exactly where it clicked, and the toolbar's cURL button
  sits right next to Send) rather than scanning with one incidentally left
  open, and broadening a dormant-dialog-shell detector from one specific
  placeholder-comment string to the general shape (any element whose sole
  content is an HTML comment), since Secrets Manager's and Settings' own
  confirm dialogs share the same closed-shell pattern already documented
  for the pre-existing one. None of this was reproducible before switching
  off the dev server, which is exactly why it had never been caught.
- **A successful Send no longer wipes the entire composer.** `sendRequest()`
  called `resetForm()` unconditionally after every send: method, URL,
  headers, body, and auth all vanished the instant a response arrived, with
  no way to tweak a header and resend, the single most basic workflow every
  API client supports. The composer now stays exactly as composed; the new
  explicit "New Request" action is the only thing that clears it.
- Loading a saved collection request into the composer (double-click in the
  sidebar) silently dropped its auth config, pre/post-request scripts, and
  tests. The tree only ever emitted a lossy history-shaped object carrying
  method/url/headers/body. It now emits the full `RequestDoc` and the
  composer's new `loadCollectionRequest()` restores everything.
- The Send button's `styleClass="send-btn"` was silently a no-op: PrimeNG's
  `pButton` *attribute* directive (as opposed to the `<p-button>`
  *component*) never exposed a `styleClass` input, so the button had been
  falling back to the theme's default primary-button color the whole time
  instead of the intended gradient. Switched to a plain `class` binding,
  which Angular merges onto the host element regardless of directive
  support. This surfaced a real, previously-masked WCAG AA violation: the
  default primary color (`#a5b4fc`) only has a 1.99:1 contrast ratio against
  white button text (needs 4.5:1), masked in the existing accessibility
  e2e test because the send-then-clear bug above used to disable the button
  (and thus exempt it from the contrast check) immediately after every send.
  `--gradient-accent`'s start stop is now a darker `#405DD0` (was `#4C6EF5`,
  itself only 4.32:1) so the button clears AA at every point along the
  gradient.
- The disabled "Copy as cURL" button rendered as an indistinguishable empty
  box. Wrapped in a non-disabled span carrying a tooltip explaining why it's
  disabled and a real `not-allowed` cursor (disabled native `<button>`s
  ignore author `cursor` in most browsers). Surfaced a real pre-existing
  bug while wiring this up: `ApiParamsComponent` had no `styleUrls` at all,
  so `api-params.component.css` was dead code.
- A real `@defer (on viewport)` reliability gap: its `IntersectionObserver`
  trigger could be missed entirely under rapid viewport/tab churn,
  permanently stranding a Monaco JSON editor on "Loading editor…" even with
  a genuinely non-zero-width container. Reproduced concretely with an
  instrumented Playwright script, not guessed at; fixed with an
  `on timer(400ms)` fallback trigger (OR semantics) on both Monaco-hosting
  `@defer` blocks.
- A pre-existing accessibility-test timing flake: the a11y suite scanned
  for violations immediately after the response status badge's text
  appeared, which could catch the duration/size pills mid-`animate-fade-in`
  transition, where interpolated opacity temporarily dropped their
  effective text contrast below 4.5:1 even though the token itself is
  5.31:1 at rest. Fixed by waiting for the animation to settle before
  scanning, instead of a transitional frame.
- A tooltip color-contrast bug the new cURL-button tooltip surfaced
  (`--label-secondary` on `--canvas-overlay` measured 4.27:1); switched to
  `--label-secondary-on-fill`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-21

**This project has been renamed from "API Sandbox" to "Wayfarer."** Same app,
same local-first storage model, same MIT license: only the name and visual
identity changed. We're saying this out loud rather than treating it as a
cosmetic footnote. The whole point of this project is that nothing about how
your data is stored or who can gate access to it should ever change without
you being told plainly.

### Changed

- Renamed the project "API Sandbox" → "Wayfarer" across the app UI, docs,
  package metadata, build/CI configuration, and the GitHub repository. The
  physical IndexedDB database name, and the collection/environment export
  schema `$id`s, are intentionally left unchanged (renaming them would force
  a lossy data migration or break already-exported files against a domain
  that isn't live yet); see `docs/storage.md` for the full reasoning.
- Replaced the iOS System Blue accent (`#0A84FF`/`#007AFF`) with an ownable
  "Wayfarer Indigo" hue across both the dark and light themes, including the
  brand gradient, focus rings, and the GET method color that previously
  matched the old accent 1:1.
- Replaced the app's mark with a route/waypoint glyph (a bending route line
  ending in a filled waypoint dot), regenerated across the favicon and the
  full PWA icon set, and added an `apple-touch-icon` link that was previously
  missing.
- HAR exports now report `Wayfarer` as the creator tool (only affects newly
  generated exports; previously exported files are unaffected).

### Added

- A Playwright `e2e` job in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), closing the gap
  the CI config's own `TODO` had tracked since Playwright specs landed in the
  `e2e/` directory but were never wired into the pipeline.
- OSS repository hygiene: `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
  (Contributor Covenant v2.1), `SECURITY.md`, GitHub issue forms
  (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`, `config.yml`),
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, a CI workflow
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint, unit test, production build with
  budget enforcement, plus the e2e job above), and `.github/dependabot.yml`
  (weekly npm + GitHub Actions updates).
- `docs/scripts.md` documenting the real, verified `pm.*` scripting API
  surface and the current script-sandbox isolation model (including its
  known limitation; see the Security section below).
- README badges (build status, license, coverage placeholder).

### Documentation

- Reconciled the product roadmap doc: removed the "destroy this file"
  instruction and marked the shipped scripts/assertions rows as done in its
  competitive gap table.
- Rewrote `README.md` for the Wayfarer identity: removed stale NDJSON export
  claims (the feature was never shipped), brought the feature list current
  (scripts, assertions, history drawer, secrets vault, command palette), and
  linked the new CONTRIBUTING/CODE_OF_CONDUCT/SECURITY docs.

### Security

- Pre/post-request scripts now execute inside a dedicated Web Worker
  (`script-runner.worker.ts`) instead of via `new Function()` on the main
  thread, closing a sandbox-escape gap where a script could re-acquire
  `fetch`/`document`/etc. as a language primitive regardless of
  name-shadowing. The worker realm has no `window`, `document`, cookies,
  `localStorage`, or main-thread memory access by construction, and the
  worker additionally strips its own network/storage-capable globals before
  evaluating any script. A regression suite (`script-sandbox.service.spec.ts`)
  asserts the original escape (`Function("return typeof fetch")()`
  re-acquisition) is closed. See `docs/scripts.md` for the full, verified
  isolation model.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-20

Reconstructed from the commit history up to this point; not a tagged
release yet.

### Added

- Pre/post-request scripts (Monaco-backed editor) and a visual test
  assertion builder, with a new **Tests** tab in the response viewer and a
  `pm.environment` / `pm.response` / `pm.test` / `pm.expect` scripting API.
- Secrets vault first-use passphrase setup flow.
- History drawer with date-grouped, relative timestamps.
- Collections tree "load into composer" with scroll-to-focus behavior.
- Copy as cURL, a dedicated Query Params editor, an Auth tab
  (Bearer / Basic / API Key), and PWA activation.
- Collections/folders/requests CRUD with drag-and-drop reorder, inline
  rename, and deterministic import/export.
- Environment manager with a dropdown switcher, `{{var}}` resolution
  chips, and per-variable focus from the request editor.
- Encrypted secrets at rest via PBKDF2 (200k iterations, SHA-256) +
  AES-GCM-256, with lock/unlock UI and ciphertext-only IndexedDB storage.
- "Reset All Data" action to clear IndexedDB and local settings in one
  guarded click.
- The "Obsidian" design system: design tokens, typography and color
  normalization, light/dark theme parity, a custom Monaco theme, and a
  dedicated motion/animation pass.
- Support for additional HTTP verbs and body type selectors in the
  request composer; a Monaco JSON editor mode.

### Fixed

- Invalid/unparseable URLs are now validated before sending, instead of
  silently resolving against the app's own origin.
- Response body/column rendering and layout fixes across the composer and
  response viewer.
- PrimeNG type-compliance fix (`contrastColor` replacing `inverseColor`)
  for theme integration.

### Removed

- NDJSON export, removed from the app. The README previously described
  it in three places after removal, which has since been corrected.

### Changed

- Method-verb color coding in the method selector.
