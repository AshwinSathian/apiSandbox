 * Worker factories, built via Angular's own `new Worker(new URL(...))`
 * syntax (statically detected and bundled by the esbuild-based builder —
 * see `webWorkerTsConfig` in angular.json, the same mechanism
 * `script-sandbox.service.ts` already uses for its own worker) rather than
 * Vite's `?worker`-suffixed dynamic-import convention this file used to use.
 *
 * That `?worker` suffix is Vite-specific: it happened to work under
 * `ng serve` only because Angular's dev server is Vite-based, but Angular's
 * production builder (`ng build`, also esbuild but not Vite) does not
 * implement it at all — it silently imports the worker file as an ordinary
 * module with no exports, so `.default` was always `undefined` in a
 * production build. Verified directly: a production build's every worker
 * resolved `.default === undefined`, while the exact same code under
 * `ng serve` resolved real constructors — meaning Monaco's background
 * workers (JSON/CSS/HTML/TS validation and completion) had never actually
 * worked in the deployed app at all, not just under the rapid-transition
 * stress case that first surfaced it as an uncaught
 * `"... is not a constructor"` page error.
 *
 * Each `./workers/*.worker.ts` file is a thin wrapper (`import
 * "monaco-editor/esm/vs/.../*.worker.js"`) purely so Angular's builder has
 * a literal, statically-analyzable relative path to treat as a worker entry
 * point — the actual worker code is still monaco-editor's own.
