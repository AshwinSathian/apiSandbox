**The API client that can't rug-pull you.**

Wayfarer is a local-first API client. No account. No cloud. No telemetry. Everything (requests, collections, secrets) lives in your browser, encrypted at rest, exportable any time. When you outgrow solo use, sync and team features will be opt-in and self-hostable, never a requirement.

**Live demo:** https://wayfarer.ashwinsathian.com/

## Why Wayfarer?

- You can't be locked out of your own work. Everything you build lives on your device by construction, not by policy: there's no update, acquisition, or pricing page that can gate access to data you already own.
- Zero clutter, just the essentials. Compose a request and see a clean, structured response.
- Great defaults: sensible method/body pairing, helpful validation, and safe fallbacks.
- Shareable results. Export a request/response as **HAR 1.2** for teammates and tooling.
- No cloud, no account, no telemetry. Collections, environments, history, and secrets all live **per‑browser, per‑device** in **IndexedDB (IDB)**, and nothing is ever uploaded.
- Dark‑first UI, with a fully designed light theme. Minimal, accessible, and keyboard‑friendly.

## Highlights

- **Request Composer**

  - Methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`
  - URL field with live validation
  - Query Params, Headers, Auth (Bearer / Basic / API Key), and Scripts tabs
  - Body editor (enabled only when it makes sense), with an optional **Monaco JSON editor** mode for power users
  - **Copy as cURL** for any request

- **Pre/Post-Request Scripts & Test Assertions**

  - Monaco-backed script editor with a `pm.environment` / `pm.response` / `pm.test` / `pm.expect` API for dynamic auth, request chaining, and response validation
  - Scripts run sandboxed in an isolated Web Worker with no access to the page, DOM, cookies, or network; see [`docs/scripts.md`](docs/scripts.md) for the full, verified isolation model
  - A visual, no-code test assertion builder (10 operators across status/body/headers/duration) as a friendlier alternative to scripting
  - Results surface in a dedicated **Tests** tab in the response viewer

- **Response Viewer**

  - Pretty JSON with collapsible sections, across **Body**, **Headers**, **Timings**, and **Tests** tabs
  - Timing (DNS → Connect → TTFB → Total) and size breakdowns
  - Copy helpers and raw view

- **Collections & Environments**

  - Collections tree with folders, drag/drop reorder, inline rename, and one-click **load into composer**
  - Environment manager with a dropdown switcher and live `{{var}}` autocomplete chips showing source + resolved value as you type
  - Deterministic collection import/export

- **Secrets Vault**

  - Client-side, encrypted-at-rest secrets: PBKDF2 (200k iterations, SHA‑256) key derivation + AES‑GCM‑256, ciphertext-only in IndexedDB, key held in memory only
  - Guided first-use passphrase setup flow; see [`docs/secrets.md`](docs/secrets.md)
  - A dedicated **Secrets management view** listing every secret across every environment in one place, with lock-aware reveal, rename, delete, and a "locate" chip that jumps to wherever a secret is referenced

- **History & Navigation**

  - History drawer with date‑grouped, relative timestamps
  - Re‑run and delete entries
  - Command palette (⌘K) for fast keyboard-driven navigation

- **Layout & Settings**

  - Resizable split between the composer and response viewer on desktop, with the chosen ratio remembered across reloads
  - A rebuilt mobile composer: one section open at a time, instead of every tab stacked and unlabeled
  - A dedicated **Settings** view for theme, environments export/import, Reset All Data, Local Bridge configuration, and a keyboard-shortcuts reference
  - Deliberate, reduced-motion-aware animation on tab switches, response arrival, and dialogs

- **Exports**

  - **HAR 1.2** – Standard archive for HTTP requests/responses (great for bug reports)
  - Large bodies are safely truncated/omitted in exports to keep files lightweight

- **PWA**

  - Installable from the browser; dark and light themes are both intentionally designed, not one inverted from the other

## Quick Start (Local)

> Requires **Node 20+** and a modern browser.

```bash
# 1) Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AshwinSathian/wayfarer.git
cd wayfarer

# 2) Install dependencies
npm ci
# (or: npm install)

# 3) Run the app (Angular dev server)
npm run start
# falls back to: ng serve --open
# then open http://localhost:4200

# 4) Production build (optimized, hashed; the same build CI runs)
npm run build

# 5) Lint / test
npm run lint
npm run test:ci
```

**Notes**

- Calling third‑party APIs may require CORS to be enabled by that API. For CORS-restrictive or intranet-only APIs, run the optional [Local Bridge](local-bridge/README.md) (`npm run bridge`) instead of a hand-rolled proxy.
- History, collections, environments, and secrets are stored locally in **IndexedDB** and are **specific to the browser and device** you're using.

---

## How it works (in 60 seconds)

- The **Request Composer** accepts a URL, method, query params, headers, auth, and (if applicable) a JSON body.
- Optional pre-request and post-response scripts (or visual assertions) run before/after the call.
- The app sends the request and shows:
  - **Body** (pretty‑printed for JSON)
  - **Headers**
  - **Timings** (DNS → Connect → TTFB → Total, plus size breakdowns)
  - **Tests** (assertion + script results)
- Each request can be **saved to a Collection** for later reuse, or replayed from **History**.
- You can **export** any call as HAR to share with teammates or attach to tickets.

---

## Privacy & Data

- Everything (requests, history, collections, environments, and secrets) is stored **locally** in your browser via **IndexedDB (IDB)**.
- **Nothing is uploaded** to our servers; there is no backend and no account system.
- You're in control: clear individual entries or wipe the entire history anytime.
- Need a clean slate? Hit **Reset All** in the toolbar. It closes the IDB connection, deletes the local database, clears app-specific storage, and reloads the app.

## FAQ

**Does this replace Postman/Insomnia?**  
No. Wayfarer is intentionally smaller and faster for everyday calls, docs checks, and quick debugging.

**Why HAR?**  
It's widely accepted by browsers, proxies, and observability tools, and is great for attaching to bug reports.

**Can I use form data or files?**  
Current focus is JSON APIs. Form/file helpers may land later.

**Will there be a light theme?**  
Yes, dark and light themes both ship today, each intentionally designed.

**Are my secrets/API keys safe?**  
Secrets are encrypted at rest with AES‑GCM‑256 and a PBKDF2‑derived key that only ever exists in memory. See [`docs/secrets.md`](docs/secrets.md) for the full model, and [`docs/scripts.md`](docs/scripts.md) for what scripts can and can't reach.

**Wait, wasn't this called API Sandbox?**  
Yes, this project was renamed from API Sandbox to Wayfarer. Same app, same storage model, same MIT license: only the name and identity changed, never the promise that your data stays on your device. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details.
